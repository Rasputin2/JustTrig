But triangles come in lots of different shapes and sizes.  Some triangles with specific angles or combinations of angles have unique properties, and so we give them special names. Above you see an 'equilateral' triangle. All three of it's sides have the exact same length and each of it's angles is precisely 60 degrees.  Each of the dots you see are referred to (for every triangle, not just equilateral triangles) as a 'vertex', the plural of which is 'vertices'. Although the length of each side may change, an equilateral triangle's sides will all be of equal length and each angle must be 60 degrees.",

Unlike the equilateral triangle, it only has two equal sides (the side between the red and green vertices and the side between the blue and green vertices).  We know, then, that the two angles opposite those sides are identical.  In this case, the two identical angles (the one at the red dot and the blue vertices) are 75 degrees.  That is not always the case.  The two angles could each have been 20 degrees or 30 degrees.  All we know is that if it is an isoceles, then two of the three angles must be equal.  But this is still a lot of information.  For example, given that the angles have to sum to 180 degrees (because the three angles of a triangle always sum to 180 degrees), and we know the angle at the red vertex equals 75 degrees, you can immediately figure out the other angles.  You know the angle at the blue vertex is also 75 degrees and the angle at the green vertex must be 180 - 75 - 75 = 30 degrees.",

Only right triangles have a side called Hypotenuse.  In this case, two sides happen to be equal, so this triangle is ALSO considered an isoceles triangle.  But that need not be the case.  A right triangle may be an isoceles triangle if two of its angles are equal and two of its sides are equal.  If it is not an isoceles, we call it a 'scalene' triangle (i.e., a triangle where no angles are the same and no sides are the same length).",

Look to the right triangle in the diagram.  Each vertex is associated with an angle.  A is blue.  B is green.  C is red.  We don't know what angles A and B are, but we know angle C is 90 degrees because of the red square, right?",

In this case, the argument is an angle.  What do we get back?  We get back a ratio.  You remember ratios from artithmetics class.  A ratio is a numerator divided by a denominator.  In this case, the numerator is the length of the side opposite the angle.  The denominator is the length of the hypotenuse.  So, in this case, the sine of angle A is the length of the blue side divided by the length of the red side.  The sine of angle B is the length of the green side divided by the length of the red side.  What about angle C?  The sine of angle C is the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse.  It just so happens that the side opposite angle C (the right angle) is always the hypotenuse.  Thus, the sine of angle C will ALWAYS be 1.  This is important.  In this fact pattern, you don't know the length of any of the sides, so you can't compute sin(A) or sin(B), but you can still conclude that sin(C) = 1.",

The cosine of angle B is the length of the blue side divided by the length of the red side.  What about angle C?  We know angle C has an opposite side, but does it have an adjacent side?  No.  It doesn't.  So the length of it's adjacent side is '0'.  Thus, the cosine of angle C will ALWAYS be 0.

However, if we imagine a line were dropped (sometimes referred to as dropping a perpendicular) from the top vertex down to the base, like the red dashed line shown here, we bisect the equilateral triangle into 2 right-triangles.  What can we infer from this?  Well, we know that since the red line bisects the base in two, the length of each side to the left and right of the red dashed line is of length 3.  What else do we know?  We know that the angle between the red line and the base is 90 degrees (illustrated by the square).  We also know that the uppermost angle must be half of 60 degrees or 30 degrees.  So, we have two right triangles now and with angles 30-60-90 where one side has a length of 3 and the hypotenuse has a length of 6.  Pretty cool heh?",
