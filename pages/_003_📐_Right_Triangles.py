        "text_2": "We know that every triangle has to have three sides and three angles - right?  We also know those angles have to add up to 180 degrees.  But triangles come in lots of different shapes and sizes.  Some triangles with specific angles or combinations of angles have unique properties, and so we give them special names. Above you see an 'equilateral' triangle. All three of it's sides have the exact same length and each of it's angles is precisely 60 degrees.  Each of the dots you see are referred to (for every triangle, not just equilateral triangles) as a 'vertex', the plural of which is 'vertices'. Although the length of each side may change, an equilateral triangle's sides will all be of equal length and each angle must be 60 degrees.",

Unlike the equilateral triangle, it only has two equal sides (the side between the red and green vertices and the side between the blue and green vertices).  We know, then, that the two angles opposite those sides are identical.  In this case, the two identical angles (the one at the red dot and the blue vertices) are 75 degrees.  That is not always the case.  The two angles could each have been 20 degrees or 30 degrees.  All we know is that if it is an isoceles, then two of the three angles must be equal.  But this is still a lot of information.  For example, given that the angles have to sum to 180 degrees (because the three angles of a triangle always sum to 180 degrees), and we know the angle at the red vertex equals 75 degrees, you can immediately figure out the other angles.  You know the angle at the blue vertex is also 75 degrees and the angle at the green vertex must be 180 - 75 - 75 = 30 degrees.",

Only right triangles have a side called Hypotenuse.  In this case, two sides happen to be equal, so this triangle is ALSO considered an isoceles triangle.  But that need not be the case.",
