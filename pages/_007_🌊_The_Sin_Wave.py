But in all events, unless the plot is shifted (which we'll talk about in the section More_Waves) the peak of the sine wave should appear at pi/2.  The trough of the sine wave should appear at 3/2pi and the zeroes (the places where the function intersects with the x axis should be at 0 and 2pi).  This cycle repeats indefinitely in either direction.  So, for example, zeroes will occur at 4pi, and 6pi and 8pi, etc.  ",

A function takes an input - in this case the numbers on the x axis - and produces an output - i.e., the numbers on the y-axis.  Importantly, the same input cannot generate two different output values.  If that did happen, then sine wouldn't be a 'function' by definition.  Compare and contrast the graph of the circle on the left and the sine wave on the right.  On the left, a single point on the x-axis can (and does) correspond to more than one location on the y-axis.  So the formula that generates a circle (be it a Unit Circle or not) cannot be a 'function'.  In contrast, every x coordinate on the sine wave on the right correlates to a single y-value.",
