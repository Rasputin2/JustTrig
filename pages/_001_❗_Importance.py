So, we will focus on one, which is probably near and dear to every teenager's heart - the cell phone. You see, electromagnetism is one of the four known forces in the universe (the others being  gravity, the strong force and the weak force).  A 2D visualization of what an electromagnetic wave looks like is to the right.",
        "text_2": "All visibile light (like the light that emanates from the sun) is made up of electromagnetic waves, like the one shown to the right.  But there are all sorts of invisible electromagnetic waves like radio waves that are bouncing around our universe.  Cell phones wouldn't work unless humans figured out how these invisible electromagnetic waves work.  And humans wouldn't have figured out how electromagnetic waves work absent - you guessed it - trigonometry!",

For one thing, it requires you to learn a bunch of new terminology like sine, cosine, tangent, arcsine, cotangent, and radians, to name a few.  In addition, you have to learn about imaginary numbers, Euler's number, and the complex plane.  What may be most challenging is learning to visualize concepts in 2D and 3D.  We'll talk about all this in a bit.",
