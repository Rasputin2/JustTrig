        "text_2": "OK... Now we're ready to start talking about something called the 'unit circle'.  The unit circle is just an ordinary circle, but it is centered at the origin (0,0) and has a radius of one.  One what?  It doesn't matter.  It could be one meter, one mile, one kilometer.  The point is that whatever units of measurement you happen to be using, the radius is one of those units.  Now, you may be wondering, what does trigonometry have to do with circles?  I thought you said trigonometry was all about triangles!  That's true.  Trigonometry is all about triangles.  But, you can reach any point on the unit circle (see the red dot) with right triangles.  Go to the next slide to see how.",

In any of the four quadrants of the unit circle, by carefully drawing a right triangle, we can ensure that one of the vertices touches the circle.  Why is this important?  It is important, because it means that we can use that knowledge of trig functions to identify any given point on the circle.  Why do we care?  Remember in the Importance section we discussed the concept of waves.  We'll tie this all together in a moment, but there are a couple more things we need to cover first.  Be patient....",

In this case, the sin will be zero and the cos will be 1, because the length of the adjacent side will be 1 and the hypotenuse will also be 1. At (0,1) you have to imagine a right triangle with no width, and so the opposite side has length 1 and the hypotenuse has length 1, and so the sin is 1 and the cosine is 0.  Take some time and think about that before you proceed :thinking_face:.  What is really important to keep in mind here is that you can use the unit circle to determine what the sine or cosine is of ANY angle.  This is because whatever angle you choose, all you need to do is find the x and y coordinates of the point where a carefully drawn right triangle intersects with the circle.  The y coordinate will give you sine and the x coordinate will give you cosine.  Let's check out an example....",

        "text_2": f"Let's assume someone were to ask you for the cosine of 135 degrees.  How could you use what you have learned thus far to find that answer?  Well, theta_1, shown above, is what we are trying to find.  Obviously, since the angle is larger than 90 degrees we can't make a right triangle out of that.  But what if we were to drop a new line (the red line) down perpendicular to the x-axis as shown above.  Now, we have theta_2.  What is theta_2?  We know that an entire circle is 360 degrees right?  So, half a circle is 180 degrees.  If we subtract 135 from 180, we get 45, which is theta_2.  Now, we have a right triangle in the second quadrant defined by the white rotated line, the x-axis and the red perpendicular line.  We know the right angle is 90 degrees and theta_2 is 45 degrees.  Thus, given triangles have to have only 180 degrees, we know the other angle is also 45 degrees.  What else do we know?  Well, this is the unit circle right?  So, the hypotenuse has to be '1' units long, because the radius of the unit circle is '1' and the hypotenuse here has to equal the radius of the circle. We also know that the height and width of the triangle have to be identical because the non-right angles are identical.  We also know from the pythagorean theorem ${lx.pythagorean_theorem}$ that c in this case is 1, and a and b are identical so we can rewrite the right-side of the equation as 2a^2.  So now we just do some algebra.  This simplifies to a = the square root of 1/2 which is plus or minus ${lx.square_root_2_over_2}$.  We say plus or minues because it's possible a was negative and when we squared it, the negative sign went away (i.e., a negative times a negative yields a positive).  So, believe it or not, we now have our answer.  You see, the cosine of the angle drawn from 0 to 135 degrees is the same as the cosine of 45 degrees in the third quadrant.  We know that the cosine equals the x coordinate of a carefully drawn right triangle.  What is our x-coordinate here?  It is -${lx.square_root_2_over_2}$.  Voila! :popcorn:",

        "text_2": f"Okey dokey.  Now is a good time to talk about ${lx.pi}$.  If you want to know a bit about the history of ${lx.pi}$ go back to the history section and take a look.  Also, just as a head's up, given that ${lx.pi}$ is so important, we are going to come back to it when we talk about the transcendental numbers.  But here we are focused on what ${lx.pi}$ actually is.  First and foremost, ${lx.pi}$ is an irrational number.  This means it cannot be *accurately* expressed as the ratio of two numbers (p/q).  Notice that I emphasize the word *accurately* because many people will use 22/7 as an *approximation* of ${lx.pi}$.  But, in reality, if you represent ${lx.pi}$ as a decimal, it has an infinite number of non-repeating decimal places.  For our purposes, we will just use 3.14 as an approximation.  So, ${lx.pi}$ is a number roughly equal to 3.14.  Secondly, ${lx.pi}$ always represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to it's diameter.  So, if the diameter of a circle were '1' unit in length, what would it's circumference be?  The answer is ${lx.circumference_to_pi}$.  Now, does that mean that the circumference of the Unit Circle is ${lx.pi}$?  NO!  The reason is that the Unit Circle has a radius of '1' unit.  It's diameter is '2' units.  So the circumference of the Unit Circle is 2 x ${lx.pi}$ or about 6.28 units.  So . . . that allows us to mark different points on the unit circle as shown above :point_up:.  One quarter of the way around the Unit Circle is .5 ${lx.pi}$.  Half way around the circle equals ${lx.pi}$ etc. What may be a little tricky is to understand that the same point (1,0) is both 0 ${lx.pi}$ and 2${lx.pi}$.  That is because what we are measuring here is not a point on the Cartesian plain, but instead the degree to which we have rotated through the circle.  So, at (1,0) we may not have rotated at all, or we may have rotated so much that we traveled all the way around the circle!  This actually brings us to the final point in this section, which is the concept of 'radians'....",

        "text_2": f"Now that we know about ${lx.pi}$ and how it relates to the Unit Circle, it's time to think about 'radians'.  Remember what we said before about mathematicians not being great about notation?  Here is one of those situations.  Almost always (but not always) when you see a reference to ${lx.pi}$ or 2${lx.pi}$ what the drafter really means is ${lx.pi}$ **radians** or 2${lx.pi}$ **radians**.  What the heck does that mean?  What is a **radian**?  It's a different way to measure an angle.  Most of us, when we want to measure an angle, think in terms of 'degrees' from 0 to 360.  Not everyone did it that way.  If you look at the history section we told you that the ancient Babylonians measured angles differently.  They used arc length to measure angles.  Look at the above diagram :point_up:.  There are two ways to represent ${lx.theta}$.  For example, you could say that ${lx.theta}$ is 45 degrees.  Alternatively, you could measure the angle as ${lx.pi}$/4 **radians**.  This actually provides us more information because it actually gives us two pieces of information.  First, by saying ${lx.pi}$/4 we know we have rotated 1/8th of the way around the origin right?  Since it takes 2${lx.pi}$ to go all the way around the origin, then 1/8th of that is ${lx.pi}$/4.  Second, it tells us how far we've traveled in terms of distance.  Specifically, if the radius of our circle is 1 meter, then the arc length is 1 x ${lx.pi}$/4 meters.  If the radius of our circle is 1 mile, then the arc length is 1 x ${lx.pi}$/4 miles.  In this way, measuring angles in radians gives us more information than degrees.  Degrees don't specify how far we have traveled.  They only indicate the amount of rotation.",

        "text_2": f"But what about other circles?  The radius of the Unit Circle is, by definition, 1 unit.  What about larger (or smaller) circles?  Don't worry.  The same principles apply. Take a look at the blue circle and the red circle shown above.  The blue circle's radius is 1 meter.  The red circle's radius is 3 meters.  The angle (theta) is 45 degrees in both cases.  Theta is ${lx.pi}$/4 *radians* in both cases.  So the angle of rotation about the axis is identical for both circles.  What is different is that the arc length is 1 meter x ${lx.pi}$/4 in the blue circle and 3 meters x ${lx.pi}$/4 in the red circle.  That is the key difference.",
