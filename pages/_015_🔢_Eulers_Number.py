For our purposes, I want to go back to 1683, and a guy named Jacob Bernoulli, who was tasked with coming up with a formula for infinite compounding of bank interest. As you probably know, when you buy a car or a house on credit, you pay interest. While the interest *rate* is very important, the manner in which the interest *compounds* is just as important. For example, if I agreed on January 1st to pay you cash at the end of year, would you rather have me pay you $100 plus: (A) 3% compounded quarterly; (B) 6% compounded semi-annually; or (C) 9% compounded annually.  The answer is (A), which yields $112.56. The question the Italian banking houses posed to Bernoulli back in the Renaissance was how to determine what the amount would be if interest literally compounded constantly - similar to interest compounding every nanosecond of every day from January 1st to December 31st. That number can be derived by taking the limit of the expression in (i) as n approaches infinity, or by recognizing, as Euler did, that e can also be represented as a series shown in (ii). Either way, you get a number approximating (but not equaling) 2.718. Like pi, Euler's number is irrational, so it can only be approximated to a chosen number of decimal places.",
