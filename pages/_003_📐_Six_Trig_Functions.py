Let's talk about each word separately.  RECIPROCAL: You probably know that the word reciprocal of 'x' in math means '1/x', right?  That is what we mean here.  RESULT: we mean that you should take 1/sin(x) or 1/cos(x) or 1/tan(x). We'll go through some examples.  For now, just know that sin is associated with cosecant (csc), cosine is associated with secant (sec), and tangent is associated with cotangent (cot) :point_up:.",

Thus, the cosecant of the angle at A (or csc(A)) is simply 1 over that ratio.  Stated another way, the csc(A) equals the ratio of the red side over the blue side.  Similarly, the csc(B) is the red side over the green side.  Finally, the csc(C) is 1.  How do we know this?  Well, we already know that the sine of 90 is 1 and 1/1 is also 1. :smiley:.",

So the secant of the angle at A is just the red hypotenuse divided by the green side.  The cosine of the angle at B is the blue side divided by the red side, and so the secant of B is the red side over the blue side.  What about the right angle - the angle at vertex C?  The secant of 90 degress is undefined.  Why?  Because the cosine of 90 is 0 and 1/0 is undefined. :smiley:",
